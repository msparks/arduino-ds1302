# DS1302 RTC library for Arduino

This project is a library for the [Arduino](http://arduino.cc) platform. It
provides a simple interface to the
[Maxim DS1302](http://www.maxim-ic.com/quick_view2.cfm/qv_pk/2685/t/al)
timekeeping chip. It allows Arduino projects to keep accurate time easily.

## Installing

Place the `DS1302` directory in the `libraries` subdirectory of your Arduino
sketch directory. On OS X, for example, your sketch directory might be:

    /Users/you/Documents/Arduino

In that case, you should put the `DS1302` directory at:

    /Users/you/Documents/Arduino/libraries/DS1302

A simple example, [set_clock](examples/set_clock), is included.
